## Other Development Methodologies. Worst practices in Project Management

- [nichesoftware.co.nz: Other Development Methodologies](http://www.nichesoftware.co.nz/other-methodologies.html) We’ve all heard of Test-Driven Development (aka TDD), and those of us who’ve been around the block a few times have no double heard of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Domain Driven Development (DDD) as well. But have you heard of their dodgy cousins? In this series I want to explore a handful of these lesser-known development methodologies, exploring both what they are, and what you might want (or need) to do to address them when they occur.

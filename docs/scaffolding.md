### Java Scaffolding with Maven
- Maven supports project scaffolding, based on project templates (called archtype). This is provided by the archetype plug-in. Maven provides archetypes for almost anything, from a simple Java application to a complex web application. The goal of this scaffolding is to allow a fast start into the Maven world. It provides the "standardized" folder structure of software projects.
- You can create a project by executing the generation goal on the archetype plugin via the following command: ```mvn archetype:generate```.

## Introduction

- [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) Use Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes and applications running on Kubernetes. This repository collects Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

- [shivanshu1333.medium.com: Structured logging in Kubernetes](https://shivanshu1333.medium.com/structured-logging-in-kubernetes-58cf35e6d60d)
    - Logs are an essential aspect of observability and a critical tool for debugging. But Kubernetes logs have traditionally been unstructured strings, making any automated parsing difficult and any downstream processing, analysis, or querying challenging to do reliably.
    - In Kubernetes 1.19, we are adding support for structured logs, which natively support (key, value) pairs and object references. We have also updated many logging calls such that over 99% of logging volume in a typical deployment are now migrated to the structured format.
    - To maintain backwards compatibility, structured logs will still be outputted as a string where the string contains representations of those “key”=”value” pairs. Starting in alpha in 1.19, logs can also be outputted in JSON format using the --logging-format=json flag.

## SLOs in Kubernetes

- [==thenewstack.io: Service Level Objectives in Kubernetes==](https://thenewstack.io/service-level-objectives-in-kubernetes/) an SLO is simply a metric, a goal for that metric, and a time period. For instance: “the success rate for service A must be at least 99.7% percent over the past 30 days.” The metric is known as the “service level indicator” (SLI) and the goal is the “objective.”

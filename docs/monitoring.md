Let’s look at this problem for handling your logs at scale and Logging infrastructure System Design.
- [medium.com: Monitoring Microservices - Part 1: Observability | Anderson Carvalho](https://medium.com/geekculture/monitoring-microservices-part-1-observability-b2b44fa3e67e) Achieving observability with probes, logs, metrics, and traces. **The Observability Pyramid comprises Probes, Logs, Metrics, and Traces:**
    - **Probes:** Probes are often exposed as endpoints and used by external agents like load balancers, container orchestrators, application servers, and sysadmins before deciding what to do next. The most common probes are starting, ready, and live. The startup probe is on during the component bootstrap phase. The liveness probe is on from the time the component starts until it stops running. The readiness probe is on during the period where the component is ready/open to receive requests or process workload.
    - **Logs:** Logs are messages produced during the component execution that capture a piece of relevant information. Usually, we classify log messages into all, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal. Logs can produce a huge amount of data and contain sensitive information. A good practice is to apply different log levels depending on the environment.
    - **Log Aggregation:** Each component generates one or more log files. Since distributed systems are composed of multiples components, it’s a daunting and miserable task to dig into a bunch of log files during troubleshooting. Thus, log aggregation is highly recommended for Microservices.
    - **Metrics:** Metrics give us the visibility of good and bad events that happen inside of an application. Metrics help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal application behavior. Usually, we collect, count, summarize and compare events related to rate, errors, duration, and saturation to produce metrics.
    - **Traces:** Traces record the flow of data between different components and execution details of each one along the way. By tracing we can discover the relationships, dependencies between components, identify bottlenecks, comprehend the data flow, and the time span on each component.

## OpenShift Cluster Monitoring Built-in solutions

### OpenShift 3.11 Metrics and Logging

OpenShift Container Platform Monitoring ships with a Prometheus instance for cluster monitoring and a central Alertmanager cluster. In addition to Prometheus and Alertmanager, OpenShift Container Platform Monitoring also includes a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance as well as pre-built dashboards for cluster monitoring troubleshooting. **The Grafana instance that is provided with the monitoring stack, along with its dashboards, is read-only.**

#### Custom Grafana Dashboard for OpenShift 3.11

By default OpenShift 3.11 Grafana is a read-only instance. Many organizations may want to add new custom dashboards. This custom grafana will interact with existing Prometheus and will also add all out-of-the-box dashboards plus few more interesting dashboards which may require from day to day operation. Custom Grafana pod uses OpenShift oAuth to authenticate users and assigns "Admin" role to all users so that users can create their own dashboards for additional monitoring.

[Getting Started with Custom Dashboarding on OpenShift using Grafana](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-toolkit/tree/master/custom-dashboards). This repository contains scaffolding and automation for developing a custom dashboarding strategy on OpenShift using the OpenShift Monitoring stac

#### Capacity Management Grafana Dashboard

[This repo](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-toolkit/tree/master/capacity-dashboard) adds a capacity management Grafana dashboard. The intent of this dashboard is to answer a single question: Do I need a new node? . We believe this is the most important question when setting up a capacity management process. We are aware that this is not the only question a capacity management process may need to be able to answer. Thus, this should be considered as the starting point for organizations to build their capacity management process.

#### Software Delivery Metrics Grafana Dashboard

[This repo](https://github.com/redhat-cop/pelorus) contains tooling to help organizations measure Software Delivery and Value Stream metrics. 

#### Prometheus for OpenShift 3.11

[This repo](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/release-3.11/examples/prometheus) contains example components for running either an operational Prometheus setup for your OpenShift cluster, or deploying a standalone secured Prometheus instance for configurating yourself.

### OpenShift 4

OpenShift Container Platform includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster components and includes a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems and a set of Grafana dashboards. The cluster monitoring stack is only supported for monitoring OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

OpenShift Cluster Monitoring components cannot be extended since they are read only. 

[Monitor your own services (technology preview)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/release_notes/ocp-4-3-release-notes.html): The existing monitoring stack can be extended so you can configure monitoring for your own Services.

    |  | __AWS ESS__ | __Elastic Cloud__ | __Self-hosted__ | 
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | __Operational Burden__ | __Medium__. Requires intimate knowledge of other AWS services to go beyond defaults. | __Low__. Backups, version upgrades, etc. are automated. | __High__. You need to provision, configure and maintain the cluster(s) yourself. |
    | __Cost__ | __Medium__. Over 50% premium on underlying infrastructure cost. | __High__. Up to 3x the cost of underlying infrastructure.| __Low__. Only pay for the underlying infrastructure. Optionally can purchase x-pack license for additional features and support. |
    | __Configurability__ | __Low__. No support for custom plugins. Several configuration parameters are not available. | __Medium__. Does support custom plugins and all parameters are available. Lack of direct node ssh access. | __High__. Full node-level acess. |
    | __Monitoring__ | __Mediocre__. Kibana monitoring is not available. Cloudwatch is often inadequate for Elasticsearch monitoring. | __Good__. Kibana monitoring available and pre-installed. | __Depends__. It is up to you to implement an adequate monitoring system, but you have access to kibana monitoring. |
    | __Future-proof__ | __Medium__. Oftern lags several minor versions behind the latest Elasticsearch version. Some features are not available at all. | __High__. Same day Elasticsearch version parity. All features are available. | __High__. Up to you to upgrade as needed, but in theory the same Elastic Cloud. |

- [FastThread.io](https://fastthread.io/): Thread dumps can be uploaded via Web or API Call from within the POD (jstack must be available within the container):

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Generate N thread dumps of the process PID with an INTERVAL between each dump.
if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
   echo Generates Java thread dumps using the jstack command.
   echo
   echo usage: $0 process_id repetitions interval
   exit 1
fi 
PID=$1
N=$2
INTERVAL=$3 
for ((i=1;i<=$N;i++))
do
   d=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   dump="threaddump-$PID-$d.txt"
   echo $i of $N: $dump
   jstack -l $PID > $dump
   curl -X POST --data-binary @./$dump https://fastthread.io/fastthread-api?apiKey=<APIKEY> --header "Content-Type:text"
   sleep $INTERVAL
done
```

- How to run this script from within the POD: ```./script_thread_dump.sh 1 15 3```, where:
    - “1”: PID of java process (“1” in containers running a single process, check with “ps ux” command).
    - “15”: 15 repetitions or thread dumps
    - “3”: interval of 3 seconds between each thread dump.
- According to some references only 3 thread dumps captured in a timeframe of 10 seconds is necessary (when we want to troubleshoot a Java issue during a service degradation).

- A major component of the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification) is **distributed tracing**.
- **Tracing** is about analyzing, recording, and describing transactions.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Troubleshooting requests between interconnected cloud-based microservices can’t always be done with logs and metrics alone. This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a  detailed view of individual requests as they “hop” through a system of microservices. With **distributed tracing** you can:
    - Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system.
    - Discover the latency of the components along that path.
    - Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure.
- **Performance:** Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It's possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn't one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. **Adding traces with [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter.** 
- **Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World:** In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams.
    - For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can't schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like [Istio](https://istio.io/) exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/), you can deeply understand what's happening with and within each service.
    - All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team — not just for the operations team.

Red Hat AMQ Broker (ActiveMQ Artemis)|Prometheus plugin for AMQ Broker<br/>To monitor the health and performance of your broker instances, you can use the **Prometheus plugin for AMQ Broker** to monitor and store broker runtime metrics. Prometheus is software built for monitoring large, scalable systems and storing historical runtime data over an extended time period. The **AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format**, enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data.<br/>You can also use a graphical tool, such as **Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards** for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects.<br/>The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself.|[ref1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/managing_amq_broker/prometheus-plugin-managing), [ref2](https://github.com/lbroudoux/openshift-cases/tree/master/jboss-amq7-custom), [ref3](https://www.openshift.com/blog/enhanced-openshift-jboss-amq-container-image-for-production)
Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka)|[JMX](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html), OpenTracing+Jaeger <br/>ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using [Java Management Extensions (JMX)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javamanagement.html). Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans.<br/> **JMX** works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, **external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on.** By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect.<br/>**Distributed Tracing with Jaeger:**<br/> - Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as Kafka clients)<br/> - MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect <br/> - Kafka Bridge|[ref1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/using_amq_streams_on_rhel/index),[ref2](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/using_amq_streams_on_rhel/assembly-distributed-tracing-str)
Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator|AMQ Streams Operator (Prometheus & Jaeger), strimzi, jmxtrans<br/>How to monitor AMQ Streams Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for example Grafana dashboards.<br/>Support for distributed tracing in AMQ Streams, using **Jaeger**:<br/> - You instrument Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data.<br/>  - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams. To configure these components for distributed tracing, you configure and update the relevant custom resources.|[ref1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/assembly-metrics-setup-str), [ref2](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/assembly-distributed-tracing-str), [ref3 strimzi](https://operatorhub.io/operator/strimzi-kafka-operator), [ref4: **jmxtrans**](https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans), [ref5: banzai operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/banzaicloud-kafka-operator)
Red Hat AMQ Broker Operator|Prometheus (recommended) or Jolokia REST to JMX <br/>To monitor runtime data for brokers in your deployment, use one of these approaches:<br/> - [Section 9.1, “Monitoring broker runtime data using Prometheus”](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#assembly_br-monitoring-broker-runtime-data-using-prometheus_broker-ocp)<br/> - [Section 9.2, “Monitoring broker runtime data using JMX”](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#proc_br-monitoring-broker_broker-ocp) <br/>In general, using Prometheus is the recommended approach. However, you might choose to use the Jolokia REST interface to JMX if a metric that you need to monitor is not exported by the Prometheus plugin. For more information about the broker runtime metrics that the Prometheus plugin exports, [see Section 9.1.1, “Overview of Prometheus metrics”](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#con-br-overview-of-prometheus-metrics_broker-ocp)|[ref1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/deploying-broker-on-ocp-using-operator_broker-ocp), [ref2](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp), [ref3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#assembly_br-monitoring-broker-runtime-data-using-prometheus_broker-ocp), [ref4](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#proc_br-monitoring-broker_broker-ocp), [ref5](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/deploying_amq_broker_on_openshift/assembly_br-broker-monitoring_broker-ocp#con-br-overview-of-prometheus-metrics_broker-ocp)

It was an international project coordinated from Munich with remote work from other european countries and regular flights. The client was a major multinational car manufacturer with a big investment in OpenShift and Cloudbees/Jenkins infrastructure. Our role was to help the client with their pretty large CI/CD ecosystem while also implementing a new self-service developer platform, involving areas of development and operations and within a DevOps model. Requirements and way of working included continuous improvement, standardization, boilerplates and automation with a GitOps pattern, a highly recommended approach specially in demanding projects like this with hundreds of real microservices, a large number of IaC &amp; CI/CD pipelines, hundreds (thousands?) of developers and millions of end users.</p> <p>Since then I try to apply in my country what I learnt from the germans and other european colleagues.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a freelancer and most of the time I work as a contractor, which in Spain means to be hired as an employee by an external company.</p> <p>Suggesting improvements and best practices or applying quality standards and automated solutions that work well and are easy to verify shouldn\u2019t penalize a career, but it\u2019s terribly common. I am concerned about working with some colleagues or managers who consider it a threat, generating absurd conflicts, blame games and acting in bad faith or stupidly distorting the purpose of the project.</p> <p>In a service driven IT sector (with calculated ambiguities and many hidden interests) the product is the hours billed by the consultant, being almost irrelevant the content of the job and the delivered quality. It is thus too common to find technical solutions under the policy of applying \u201cthe most difficult, non-standard, slowest and most obfuscated way possible\u201d as a competitive element (the hard way and doing weird things). This does not scale. Being ambiguous in JDs (not to say dishonest) without clarifying the real content of the job is easy and very well paid.</p> <p>Ambiguities about DevOps term. Development of new ad-hoc devops tools and ad-hoc monitoring solutions should not be the role of devops specialists. DevOps professionals develop IaC and CI/CD pipelines with standard tools and code, ideally with a cattle service model, GitOps patterns &amp; kubernetes among other responsabilities such as application monitoring. The development of devops tools for kubernetes with i.e. client-go should be clearly mentioned in a JD as \u201csoftware development of devops tools for kubernetes with client-go\u201d (suitable for a software engineer with client-go skills, a developer of devops/kubernetes/monitoring tools). In addition, a DevOps specialist should not be a fullstack developer who occasionally does QA + DevOps + Cloud Design/Ops. Moreover, avoid confusing terms to justify these different backgrounds by creating two roles like DevOps Software Developer and DevOps SysAdmin. Maybe DevOps should be renamed as OpsDev to avoid misunderstandings.</p> <p>A tech stack is not relevant compared to the way technology is managed. You could have the best tool and run into trouble by taking the risk of applying an unsupported or not recommended<sup>1</sup> approach.</p> <p>DevOps principles: People, processes, technology</p> <p>GitOps principles: Correctness, doing DevOps correctly</p> Principle Focus Main Tool Other Tools Flexibility Correctness DevOps Automation and frequent deployments CI/CD pipeline Supply chain management, Cloud Configuration as Code, etc. Less strict and more open Less focus on correctness GitOps Correctness; doing DevOps correctly Git Kubernetes, Controller (e.g., Operator), separate CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as a Code, etc. Stricter and less open Designed with correctness <p>The SRE Experience Is Changing with Cloud Native:</p> <ul> <li>From Firefighting to Prevention for SREs.</li> <li>Empower Developers with Self-Service.</li> <li>Facilitate Developer Autonomy.</li> <li>Adopting a New Code-Ship-Run Paradigm.</li> </ul> Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) team Developers Operations team Provide and teach effective use of platform tooling to empower developers to be self-sufficient Treat SREs as application operation partners, not only as first responders to incidents Provide self-service platform deployment and observability, and enable visibility into ramifications of actions Document clear escalation paths for developers struggling in production Turn to ops teams for the \u201cpaved path\u201d or centralized developer control plane Provide opinionated \u201cpaved path\u201d platform or developer control plane (DCP), but allow developers to swap platform components if they also want to be accountable <p>Avoiding standardization, automation and improvements because rivals do not invest in them is shortsighted. It is worrying because there is considerable resistance to change along with employment discrimination to prevent new proposals from succeeding. The term DevOps first appeared in 2009.</p> <p>In this service driven IT sector, cloud certifications and technical assesment tests have much more weight in the selection processes that have little to do with real work. They are mostly a wall to justify the hiring of less experienced (younger and cheaper) employees. Fundamental in any profession to learn by doing while building a career and skills with decent opportunities and without too many difficulties and barriers.</p> <p>A consequence of these technical assessment tests is the willingness to learn how to pass them while only implementing and practicing this specific knowledge at work. If assessments are about low level concepts then there\u2019s no interest in abstractions, frameworks and enterprise standards (real work). Similar scenario when evaluating kubernetes knowledge with manual tasks (CLI) instead of gitops pipelines (real work<sup>2</sup>).</p> <p>Inbreeding is not a good strategy in IT. Hiring people with different background and skills is a better bet. Cronyism, kiss up kick down and blame games hurt employee retention and economic growth. This is terrible common too. If an employee doesn\u2019t trust their manager, the company suffers. Sure, ruling through fear works, but the employee will do the bare minimum amount of work needed to keep their job (manually and without automation).</p> <p>Culture of mutual trust is key to beating competition and increasing employee retention. When something isn\u2019t right the employee should be able to bring it up without being afraid of being fired.</p> <p>We are in business to make money, perhaps not only creating value on financial markets with jargon like margin and cost effective, common in financially driven companies.</p> <p>Everyone sells the same thing: cloud, devops, big data, etc. Speaking is cheap. Throwing an SQL statement doesn\u2019t make you an SQL expert. Likewise, you don\u2019t need to be an SQL expert on every job. Actually most of the jobs require generalists rather than specialists, above all in countries where most companies are SMEs.</p> <p>There are very few unicorns and to a certain extent it depends a lot on the environment created.</p> <p>CKA is the top Kubernetes certification but only a few employers require one. Same logic applies to other certifications.</p> <p>It is surprising the numerous resources and the strategy of psychological exhaustion of recruitment companies that continuously bombard us with interviews. They also force us to transfer our data to third parties without any control of where our CV ends. It is also very common to gather information from detailed CVs and interviews to afterwards publish similar JDs that can be sold as services to potential clients. Again, only the service name is what matters, not how this is implemented and whether the client have the capacity to implement it in a proper manner.</p> <p>As professionals we are obliged to a high commitment to our clients, sometimes sacrificing our well-being in order to achieve the objectives. Everyone has limits, sometimes being a personal decision to abandon a project without this entailing a penalty in the next job (we have given our CV to third parties without any control). An unfair bad reference (blame games) and calculated ambiguities can ruin our careers. And I\u2019m not talking about an isolated case.</p> <p>Losing employment and significantly penalizing employability and economic bargaining power for defending the value of automation, continuous improvement and standardization in computer engineering is a high price to pay. The alternatives often seem to be manual work with low salary expectations, lack of opportunities with new cloud jobs (better paid), promotion to a management position or emigration to countries with a different economic model (where technical jobs are better valued). This does not scale either. Freelancing worldwide is not for everyone either.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems in IT is that we keep reinventing the wheel. We are running the same circles, producing similar technologies to solve the same problems. Reinventing the wheel is a great way to learn how the wheel works, but not an efficient way to build software\u201d (@dmokafa)</p> <p>\u201cTech industry thinks throwing more tools to the problem is the solution. More tools = more failure modes\u201d (@rakyll)</p> <p>Instead of reinventing the wheel by rewriting from scratch a new installer or ad-hoc devops tool to manage/monitor kubernetes, please pay attention to the links shared here and learn how to add value on the so called day 2. You will find solutions and knowledge in a practical and efficient way without being totally essential to obtain a certification to successfully complete the task. For example, if there\u2019s money for reinventing the wheel on day 1, then there\u2019s money for investing in these high value added solutions on day 2 where automation can significantly improve our lives and the quality of the delivered service. Automation is also a key element when evaluating the delivery of a service.</p> <p>Nubenetes shares relevant information that helps spread the new technological and cultural standards, in order to eliminate bottlenecks and silos and promote digital transformation.</p> <p>Does saying this publicly imply being blacklisted and losing professional opportunities? What kind of society do we live in?</p> <p>Tips: ask the hiring manager what experience they have with Cloud Automation, Cloud Managed Services and K8s in Production, if they deploy OpenShift via IPI<sup>1</sup> or UPI, whether they are familiar with Gitops as the correct way of doing DevOps, if they work with modern, easy-to-use automation tools (terraform, ansible modules with YAML/Jinja templates, argocd, helm, an automation server<sup>3</sup> to run pipelines, declarative code in Jenkins<sup>4</sup> Pipelines or in DevOps Azure Pipelines, IaC boilerplates instead of k8s vanilla, etc) or they are not practical and prefer to develop their own ad-hoc tools with millions of lines of code that need maintenance (by who?). If any doubt, ask them to show you their pipelines and custom solutions, how long it takes them to deploy and setup their k8s infra on day 1 &amp; day 2 (pets vs cattle service model), how long it takes them to deploy a single app and if the process is fully automated or not, what monitoring solutions they have, if security and Role-based Access Control (RBAC) are implemented in their k8s clusters, whether changes and PoCs are tested first in ephemeral and isolated K8s/Cloud infra test environments with IaC &amp; CI/CD pipelines, if solutions can be discussed within the team, etc.</p> <p>\u201cThe absolutely difficult thing is reaching volume production without going bankrupt, that is the actual hard thing\u201d Elon Musk</p> Click to expand! <p> </p> <p>\u201cI am a big fan of the scientific method.

You may also be responsible for the data center, power, Internet service, and other underlying aspects.</li> <li>Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS (Take &amp; Bake) the cloud vendor is responsible for the stack from networking through virtualization and your IT team is responsible for the Operating System (OS) through the applications. Common uses of IaaS are testing environments, development environments or hosting of a website.</li> <li>Platform as a Service: In PaaS (Pizza Delivered) the cloud vendor is responsible for the networking layers through the runtime layer and your IT team is responsible for the data and the applications. PaaS is commonly used to test, build and deploy applications for an organization.</li> <li>Software as a Service: In SaaS (Dining Out) the cloud vendor is responsible for all layers from the networking through to the application layer. A common example of SaaS is a web-based email service such as Outlook, Hotmail or Gmail.</li> </ul> </li> <li>medium: Scaling Applications in the Cloud</li> <li>thenewstack.io: Azure Kubernetes Service Replaces Docker with containerd</li> <li>blog.sixeyed.com: You can\u2019t always have Kubernetes: running containers in Azure VM Scale Sets</li> <li>devblogs.microsoft.com: Deploy Spring Boot applications by leveraging enterprise best practices \u2013 Azure Spring Cloud Reference Architecture</li> <li>techcommunity.microsoft.com: Non-interactive logins: minimizing the blind spot In this blog post, we will review the new Azure Sentinel data streams for Azure Active Directory non-interactive, service principal, and managed identity logins.

There are two basic frameworks to achieve the same:<ul> <li>ETL: Extract \u2014 Transform \u2014 Load</li> <li>ELT: Extract \u2014 Load \u2014 Transform</li> </ul> </li> <li>However, in both the frameworks the common element is to be able to extract the data and load it into another destination. This is Data Ingestion.</li> <li>On a broad categorization, there are mainly 3 types of Data Ingestion:<ul> <li>Batch-based Data Ingestion: Batch-based ingestion happens at a regularly scheduled time. The data is ingested in batches. This is important when a business needs to monitor daily reports, ex: sales reports for different stores. This is the most commonly used data ingestion use case.</li> <li>Real-time/Streaming Data Ingestion:<ul> <li>The process of gathering and transmitting data from source systems in real-time solutions such as Change Data Capture (CDC) is known as Real-Time Data Ingestion.</li> <li>CDC or Streaming Data captures any changes, new transactions, or rollback in real time and moves changed data to the destination, without impacting the database workload.</li> <li>Real-Time Ingestion is critical in areas like power grid monitoring, operational analytics, stock market analytics, dynamic pricing in airlines, and recommendation engines.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Lambda-based Data Ingestion Architecture: Lambda architecture in Data ingestion tries to use the best practices of both batch and real-time ingestion.<ul> <li>Batch Layer: Computes the data based on the whole picture. This is more accurate however is slower to compute.</li> <li>Speed Layer: Is used for real-time ingestion, the computed data might not be completely accurate, however, gives a real-time picture of the data.</li> <li>Serving layer: The outputs from the batch layer in the form of batch views and those coming from the speed layer in the form of near real-time views get forwarded to the serving. This layer indexes the batch views so that they can be queried in low latency on an ad-hoc basis.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>mssqltips.com: Choosing Between SQL Server Integration Services and Azure Data Factory</li> <li>techcommunity.microsoft.com: Azure Data Factory: How to split a file into multiple output files with Bicep</li> </ul>"},{"location":"azure/#winget-windows-package-manager-cli","title":"WinGet Windows Package Manager CLI","text":"<ul> <li>WinGet: Welcome to the Windows Package Manager Client (aka winget.exe) repository Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget)</li> <li>muycomputer.com: WinGet 1.0, ya est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed el administrador de paquetes para Windows</li> <li>thomasmaurer.ch: Getting started with Windows Package Manager WinGet</li> </ul>"},{"location":"azure/#windows-11","title":"Windows 11","text":"<ul> <li>thenewstack.io: This Week in Programming: Windows Opens Up to Android Developers</li> </ul>"},{"location":"azure/#azure-api-management","title":"Azure API Management","text":"<ul> <li>azure.microsoft.com: Azure API Management</li> <li>jmfloreszazo.com: Monetizar un API, con Azure API Management</li> <li>github.com/Azure-Samples/api-management-workspaces-migration: Azure API Management workspaces migration tool Tooling to ease migration of Azure API Management service-level resources to workspaces.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"azure/#azure-container-apps","title":"Azure Container Apps","text":"<ul> <li>Azure Container Apps Build and deploy modern apps and microservices using serverless containers</li> <li>techcommunity.microsoft.com: Introducing Azure Container Apps: a serverless container service for running modern apps at scale</li> <li>techcommunity.microsoft.com: Azure Policy for Azure Container Apps?

DevOps compliance refers to the process of integrating compliance and security requirements into DevOps practices. DevOps is a methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other teams involved in the software development process. It aims to deliver software quickly and reliably through continuous integration, testing, and deployment.</p> <p>DevOps compliance is important because it ensures that the software being developed adheres to regulatory and security standards. This can include compliance with laws such as HIPAA or GDPR, industry-specific regulations, or organizational policies.</p> <p>DevOps compliance involves implementing security and compliance requirements into the DevOps workflow. This includes incorporating compliance checks and security testing into the development process, as well as ensuring that security and compliance concerns are addressed throughout the entire software development lifecycle.</p> <p>In summary, DevOps compliance is about balancing the need for speed and agility in software development with the need to meet regulatory and security requirements. It enables organizations to deliver software that is not only innovative and efficient but also meets the necessary compliance standards.</p>"},{"location":"chatgpt/#gitops-vs-clickops-1","title":"GitOps vs ClickOps 1","text":"<p>What is the best strategy for cloud managers? Gitops or ClickOps? As an AI language model, I cannot make a definitive recommendation between GitOps and ClickOps as the \u201cbest\u201d strategy for cloud managers, as each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific needs and goals of the organization. However, I can provide an overview of the two strategies to help you understand their differences and choose the one that best fits your needs.</p> <p>GitOps is an approach that emphasizes using Git as the source of truth for managing infrastructure and application deployment. In this approach, changes to the infrastructure or application are made via pull requests in Git, and the changes are automatically deployed to the cloud environment based on the Git commit history. GitOps enables version control of infrastructure and application configurations, and it facilitates collaboration between team members. However, it requires a significant investment in automation and tooling to set up and maintain the GitOps pipeline.</p> <p>ClickOps, on the other hand, is an approach that relies on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and point-and-click actions to manage cloud resources. This approach is typically more accessible to non-technical users and can provide a more straightforward and intuitive interface for cloud management. However, ClickOps can be more error-prone, as it does not provide the same level of visibility and transparency as GitOps, and it can be more challenging to maintain consistent infrastructure and application configurations.</p> <p>Ultimately, the choice between GitOps and ClickOps depends on the specific needs and goals of the organization, as well as the level of technical expertise of the team. For organizations that value version control, collaboration, and automation, GitOps may be the better choice, while ClickOps may be a more accessible and user-friendly option for teams with less technical experience. It is also worth noting that many organizations use a combination of both approaches, depending on the specific use case and context.</p>"},{"location":"chatgpt/#gitops-vs-clickops-2","title":"GitOps vs ClickOps 2","text":"<p>GitOps and ClickOps are different approaches to infrastructure management and application deployment in the cloud.</p> <p>GitOps focuses on automation and managing infrastructure as code (IaC) using Git as a single source of truth for configuration and version control. In this approach, changes to the infrastructure are made by updating the Git repository and the implementation of changes is automatically done through CI/CD tools.</p> <p>ClickOps, on the other hand, focuses on manual and visual management of infrastructure and application deployment using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This approach allows developers and IT operations teams to make changes and deploy applications quickly and easily without the need for knowledge of the underlying technical details.</p> <p>The problem between GitOps and ClickOps lies in how infrastructure management and application deployment are approached. GitOps is more automated and focused on IaC, which can result in greater efficiency and a reduction of human errors. ClickOps is more manual and visual, which can be easier to use and understand for teams who do not have programming and automation experience.</p> <p>In summary, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and are suited to different situations and needs.

CI/CD now has QA and security elements to it. We may have seen people refer to the current trend as DevSecOps. In my mind, DevSecOps is changing to be Dev-Infra-Sec-Ops (infrastructure-as-a-service) and will soon be called \u201cDev-Infra-Sec-Analytics-Ops (including analytics-as-a-service). One day the trend of CI/CD will eventually lead to touchless software development and maintenance. We are on the brink of major efficiency shift in the industry now and AI/ML and LCNC [low code/no code] technologies are enabling this shift.\u201d</li> <li>javacodegeeks.com: The Case Against CI/CD What\u2019s the Point of CI/CD?</li> <li>thenewstack.io: Improve Dev Experience to Maximize the Business Value of CD</li> <li>community.dataminer.services: CI/CD and the Agile Principles</li> <li>medium: Automated Build and Deploy Pipelines for Kubernetes</li> <li>medium: Next Generation Kubernetes Deployments</li> <li>levelup.gitconnected.com: Basics of CI/CD</li> <li>techrepublic.com: CI/CD platforms: How to choose the right continuous integration and delivery system for your business</li> <li>stackoverflow.blog: Fulfilling the promise of CI/CD When people say \u201cCI/CD,\u201d they are only talking about continuous integration.

If the application lacks in tests or if there is little confidence about the impact/stability of the software, then a canary, a/b testing or shadow release can be used. If your business requires testing of a new feature amongst a specific pool of users that can be filtered depending on some parameters like geolocation, language, operating system or browser features, then you may want to use the a/b testing technique.</li> <li>Last but not least, a shadow release is complex and requires extra work to mock egress traffic which is mandatory when calling external dependencies with mutable actions (email, bank, etc.).

The lack of encryption for secrets often leads to the question of how to store secrets securely. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to put your sensitive configuration data into a git repository, because it is just encoded. echo  | base64 -d.<ul> <li>A typical solution is using services like Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to persist sensitive data. Those services can be integrated with Kubernetes by using the Secrets Store CIS driver. However, relying on an additional service means that you have to manage and maintain that service in addition to Kubernetes. Additionally, depending on the service you use to store your sensitive data, some sensitive configuration must be stored somewhere to configure the CIS driver.</li> <li>As an alternative, you can use Mozilla SOPS (SOPS) to encrypt and decrypt your Kubernetes secret files. Secrets that are encrypted via SOPS can be stored in source control. Encrypted secrets will be decrypted locally just before they\u2019ll be deployed to Kubernetes.

You might need this as a way to limit the resources use, handle dev/staging environments, or just as a way to contain your tests while working on them. If you have used Helm before, you know that installing applications via Helm charts is simple by using the helm install command. The problem is that after installing a package, you or the user still needs to manually delete the package.

Event-driven architectures establish an event that can be consumed and reacted to. But what is an event? An event is essentially any significant change from one state to another, such as the change from having no messages in your inbox to have a new message in your inbox. This state can be reacted to internally (such as when the email program in question realizes a new message has been received), externally (when a user sees a notification for a new message), or used to generate another event (for instance, the message tally increases by one). Event-driven architectures are appealing to API developers because they function very well in asynchronous environments. By crafting APIs that trigger certain functions on new event delivery, API systems don\u2019t have to inherently wait for synchronous delivery or real time communication. This is hugely beneficial, as eliminating the need to constantly poll endpoints frees resources from otherwise wasteful purposes, reducing both general hardware requirements and call-specific overhead. For this reason, event-driven architectures are very, very popular, and lead to improved power, bandwidth, and co-processing than other solutions and architectures such as polling and other poll-centric derivatives.</li> <li>5 Types of Event-Driven Protocols for APIs:<ul> <li>WebSockets</li> <li>WebHooks</li> <li>REST Hooks</li> <li>Pub-Sub</li> <li>Server Sent Events</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>dev.to/aws-builders: Un Modelo de EDA: Event Driven Architectures</li> <li>levelup.gitconnected.com: Error Handling in Event-Driven Systems</li> <li>aws.amazon.com: Best practices for implementing event-driven architectures in your organization</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#understanding-the-differences-between-event-driven-message-driven-and-microservices-architectures","title":"Understanding the Differences Between Event-Driven, Message-Driven, and Microservices Architectures","text":"<ul> <li>faun.pub: Understanding the Differences Between Event-Driven, Message-Driven, and Microservices Architectures with AWS Services</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#multi-tenancy-architecture","title":"Multi-Tenancy Architecture","text":"<ul> <li>levelup.gitconnected.com: 5 Tips To Design For Multi-Tenancy Architecture</li> <li>levelup.gitconnected.com: Multi-Tenant Application</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#architecture-decision-records","title":"Architecture Decision Records","text":"<ul> <li>redhat.com: Why you should be using architecture decision records to document your project Documenting architectural decisions helps a project succeed by helping current and future contributors understand the reasons for doing things a certain way.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#self-service-developer-platform","title":"Self service developer platform","text":"<ul> <li>weave.works: What is a self-service developer platform and why does it matter?</li> <li>thenewstack.io: What We Learned from Enabling Developer Self-Service Let\u2019s simplify the developer experience and scale DevOps workflows without compromising the security of multi-Kubernetes environments.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#shift-left","title":"Shift-Left","text":"<ul> <li>dzone.com: Shift-Left: A Developer\u2019s Pipe(line) Dream?

It turns out we can. Companies such as Netflix, Zalando, and Capital One have pushed the pattern to the front, laying the groundwork for microfrontends.

Como bien dices es un espacio contiguo al heap, pero tambi\u00e9n se limpia cada vez que la tenured/old generation procede a un GC. No es una generaci\u00f3n separada del mismo modo que es la young generation, y no hay un mecanismo espec\u00edfico para un GC separado de PermGen. La tenured/old generation y la permanent generation proceden a un GC cuando una de las dos se llena.</p> <p>De todos modos no me queda claro si incorporaron PermGen dentro del heap en Java 7, aunque poco importa ya con los cambios en Java 8.</p> <p>Mejor empiezo por introducir qu\u00e9 implementaci\u00f3n de JVM es Java 8 de Oracle. Existen numerosas implementaciones de JVM y cada una utiliza diferentes soluciones para la gesti\u00f3n de memoria.</p> <p>Dos de las soluciones m\u00e1s conocidas y populares de JVM han sido HotSpot de Sun (habitual en Tomcat) y JRockit de BEA (Weblogic). Ambas compa\u00f1ias fueron compradas por Oracle y Java 8 viene a ser la integraci\u00f3n definitiva de ambas soluciones.</p> <p>Hist\u00f3ricamente se consideraba que HotSpot es el JVM con mejor rendimiento de las dos, si bien JRockit es valorada como la m\u00e1s escalable.</p> <p>Originalmente en HotSpot no hab\u00eda generaci\u00f3n permanente. Objetos y clases de JVM se almacenaban juntas. Las clases de \u00e9sta JVM eran est\u00e1ticas y pr\u00e1cticamente no se utilizaban \u2018Class Loaders\u2019 (Load y Unload/Collection de Clases). PermGen surgi\u00f3 como una mejora de rendimiento. Por defecto los datos en la generaci\u00f3n permanente no se eliminan nunca (son datos de JVM y no de aplicaci\u00f3n, pudiendo variar seg\u00fan la p\u00f3l\u00edtica de garbage collection). Esto pod\u00eda llenar la generaci\u00f3n permanente generando un OutOfMemoryErrors si se produc\u00eda un elevado n\u00famero de classloading. En muchos casos un problema con una generaci\u00f3n permanente implica reiniciar regularmente la JVM y la aplicaci\u00f3n Java.</p> <p>Actualmente las clases de JVM son din\u00e1micas y el espacio requerido para metadatos puede cambiar f\u00e1cilmente.</p> <p>A diferencia de HotSpot VM, JRockit carece de generaci\u00f3n permanente y en cambio almacena los metadatos \u2018off the heap\u2019 en memoria nativa. Estos buffers de c\u00f3digo son liberados constantemente cuando sus ClassLoaders no se utilizan. El problema de OutOfMemory en JRockit no es diferente a HotSpot, excepto por el hecho de ser memoria nativa en lugar de memoria heap. Hay dos diferencias significativas. Primero, en JRockit la limpieza de metadatos est\u00e1 habilitada siempre por defecto y segundo, no hay tama\u00f1o l\u00edmite fijo para el espacio de metadatos. Uno de los principales problemas con HotSpot es su dificultad para seleccionar un tama\u00f1o adecuado para la generaci\u00f3n permanente. \u00bf128MB, 256MB? Es muy dif\u00edcil acertar para cada aplicaci\u00f3n. JRockit es din\u00e1mico en la gesti\u00f3n de memoria reservada para metadatos y sin l\u00edmites de tama\u00f1o (a excepci\u00f3n de la memoria del sistema). JRockit es tambi\u00e9n el \u00fanico JVM con soporte de heaps no contiguos (uso de memoria por encima y por debajo del alojamiento del kernel y otras librer\u00edas), importante en el caso de Windows donde su kernel a menudo se ubica en mitad del espacio de direcciones.</p> <p>Java 8 (HotRockit?) incorpora todas las herramientas de monitorizaci\u00f3n de HotSpot (Java VisualVM, jstat, jmap) y JRockit (Java Mission Control, Java Flight Recorder). Muy interesante.</p> <p>Un inconveniente de Java 8 es la fragmentaci\u00f3n de la memoria nativa para metadatos, pero probablemente incluya compactaci\u00f3n en un futuro pr\u00f3ximo.</p> <p>En el 2016 saldr\u00e1 Java 9 con la funcionalidad de auto-tuning y soporte de tama\u00f1os Heap multi-gigas.</p> <p>En cualquier caso hay una tendencia al Heap-Offloading. El consumo de memoria en Java tiene un coste y las pausas/latencias causadas por los Full GC son proporcionales al tama\u00f1o del heap. Estas pausas son notables en tama\u00f1os de heap &gt; 1Gb, con un considerable impacto en aplicaciones de tiempo real donde un proceso que no responde r\u00e1pido puede ser descartado del cluster. A\u00fan as\u00ed, los servidores actuales hacen uso de frameworks muy pesados y f\u00e1cilmente requieren heaps &gt; 4Gb. Una soluci\u00f3n a este problema es alojar fuera del heap los objetos poco utilizados mediante t\u00e9cnicas de serializaci\u00f3n/deserializaci\u00f3n (cach\u00e9). El heap de memoria se mantiene peque\u00f1o y el Full GC se completa en milisegundos. Ejemplos:</p> <ol> <li>cach\u00e9 de sesi\u00f3n de usuarios, donde un fichero mapeado en memoria almacena gigabytes de sesiones de usuarios inactivos. Una vez que el usuario hace log-in, la aplicaci\u00f3n dispone de todos sus datos sin ser necesaria una consulta a la BBDD.</li> <li>cach\u00e9 de resultados computacionales como queries, p\u00e1ginas html, etc (donde el coste computacional es mayor a la deserializaci\u00f3n)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"java-and-java-performance-optimization/#slides","title":"Slides","text":"Click to expand!

By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline:<ul> <li>Code: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline.</li> <li>Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins master.</li> <li>Pausable: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run.</li> <li>Versatile: Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.</li> <li>Extensible: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL and multiple options for integration with other plugins.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>jenkins.io - doc/book/pipeline \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>jenkins.io - Jenkinsfile \ud83c\udf1f With version 2 of the Jenkins Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, a new job definition file has been introduced, called Jenkinsfile. The initial Jenkinsfile format was based on Groovy. As groovy knowledge is not that widespread, a new and more straight forward was published in spring 2017. This format is called Declarative Pipeline. This visual studio code extension is aimed at making the manipulation of this file type easier.</li> <li>Dzone refcard: Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>GitHub Gist - Faheetah/Jenkinsfile.groovy: Jenkinsfile idiosynchrasies with escaping and quotes</li> <li>jenkins.io: Jenkins CD and Pipelines Microsite</li> <li>dzone.com: Jenkins Pipeline - Software Delivery Made Easy Jenkins 2.0 has focused on solving the problem for organizations wanting to continuously deliver software.</li> <li>DZone refcard: declarative pipeline with jenkins \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>sdtimes.com: CI/CD pipelines are expanding \ud83c\udf1f The \u201cbasic\u201d CI/CD pipeline includes five processes, which are: merge, build, test, package and deploy.

First, a history lesson. Scripted syntax was released around December of 2014. In February 2017, Declarative syntax was introduced. Until Declarative was released, we had no choice but to use Scripted syntax. However, since that time, many new features, such as matrix, have only been made available for Declarative.</li> <li>Use shared libraries. Do you remember the days of when you used inline JavaScript in your web pages? When you introduce a \u201cscript\u201d tag into a Declarative pipeline, that\u2019s a warning sign that you are starting to head down the same path. When you decide that the \u201cscript\u201d tag is the only way to go, instead of using the \u201cscript\u201d tag, you should instead create a custom step in a shared library and use that step within your Declarative pipeline.</li> <li>Don\u2019t use shared libraries (the wrong way). Wait, what? You just told me to use shared libraries and now you\u2019re telling me not to use shared libraries. What gives? Many people will treat shared libraries like a programming project. Here\u2019s the thing to keep in mind. Scripted and Declarative syntax are meant to only do CI tasks and not to be a general purpose programming language. Many Jenkins controller performance issues can be traced back to the misuse of scripted syntax and shared libraries written in a way where all the work is being done within the Jenkins controller itself instead of on the agents.</li> <li>Only use Scripted syntax when it doesn\u2019t make sense to use Declarative plus a shared library.</li> </ul> </li> <li>cuelogic.com: Decoding Pipeline as Code (With Jenkins) \ud83c\udf1f Pipeline as code technique rests on the paradigm that delivery pipeline configuration which builds, tests, deploys applications, and software infrastructure must be treated as code.</li> <li>mishra-praveen.medium.com: Comprehensive Guide To Jenkins Declarative Pipeline [With Examples]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"jenkins/#how-to-share-a-declarative-pipeline-examples-of-declarative-pipelines-in-shared-libraries","title":"How to share a Declarative Pipeline.

The new offering strengthens CloudBees\u2019 leadership in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) space by extending users\u2019 ability to leverage feature flag technology in both on-premise and cloud environments. CloudBees Feature Flags is from the company and application formerly known as Rollout, acquired last year by CloudBees.</li> <li>Feature flags have emerged as popular tools for deploying new features with the added advantage of enabling risk-free experimentation and fast results. As organizations enhance applications with rich new capabilities, many use feature flags to preview features for select audiences, with the ability to pull them back quickly if the functionality is not successful. In a recent survey, 97% of respondents say that it is important for their organization to implement new application features quickly, yet 65% say it is difficult for their organization to do so safely. CloudBees Feature Flags enables developers to easily release new features with confidence, reduce risk in doing so and manage large numbers of feature flags at scale.</li> <li>\u201cVery soon, all features will be released behind a feature flag. It\u2019s a natural evolution in continuous delivery. CloudBees has led the way in feature flag technology, making it a core part of our overall offering,\u201d said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees. \u201cWith this release, we are providing the same functionality for on-premise environments that previously had only been available as a cloud-based service. We are committed to the ongoing integration, automation and governance of feature flags within the software delivery lifecycle and giving users choice in selecting the best environment for their project \u2013 on-premise or cloud.\u201d</li> <li>CloudBees Feature Flags integrates with the company\u2019s deep CI/CD capabilities, giving organizations the most comprehensive feature management capabilities in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The ability to use feature flagging in an on-premise environment also opens up new avenues for usage in industries, such as government, finance, pharmaceuticals, utilities and healthcare, where there can be a mix of on-premise and cloud environments.</li> <li>\u201cWe recognize that many companies are realizing the benefits of feature flags,\u201d said Moritz Plassnig, senior vice president and general manager, Software Delivery Management and Software Delivery Automation Cloud at CloudBees. \u201cBy flagging features, they no longer have to sacrifice innovation to lower risk.

The Z Garbage Collector, also known as ZGC, is a scalable low latency garbage collector designed to meet the following goals: \u00b7 Pause times do not exceed 10ms (*) \u00b7 Pause times do not increase with the heap or live-set size \u00b7 Handle heaps ranging from a 8MB to 16TB in size At a glance, ZGC is: \u00b7 Concurrent \u00b7 Region-based \u00b7 Compacting \u00b7 NUMA-aware \u00b7 Using colored pointers \u00b7 Using load barriers At its core, ZGC is a concurrent garbage collector, meaning all heavy lifting work is done while Java threads continue to execute.

There is a new flag -XX:MaxRAMPercentage, that takes a value between 0.0 and 100.0 and defaults to 25.0. So if there is a 1 GB memory limit, the JVM heap is limited to ~250 MB by default. While this can certainly be improved \u2014 depending on the RAM size and workload \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty good default compared to the old behaviour. https://medium.com/adorsys/usecontainersupport-to-the-rescue-e77d6cfea712 -XX:+UseContainerSupport Enabled by default Java 8u191+ required (enabled by default in Linux) https://medium.com/adorsys/jvm-memory-settings-in-a-container-environment-64b0840e1d9e https://medium.com/adorsys/usecontainersupport-to-the-rescue-e77d6cfea712 Please note that setting -Xmx and -Xms disables the automatic heap sizing. # check if +UseContainerSupport is enabled $ java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version -XshowSettings:vm Yes This is a priceless feature to display all the settings of the JVM, together with -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags it can show a world of hidden stuff. http://www.javamonamour.org/2018/11/java-showsettings.html -XX:MaxRAMFraction No (deprecated) Requires JDK 8u131+ -XX:MaxRAMFraction deprecated since Java 8u191+ (use -XX:MaxRAMPercentage instead) https://dzone.com/articles/running-a-jvm-in-a-container-without-getting-kille https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/14/java-inside-docker/ https://merikan.com/2019/04/jvm-in-a-container/ -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap No (deprecated) JDK 8u131+ required Deprecated in Java10 &amp; Java8u191+ https://dzone.com/articles/running-a-jvm-in-a-container-without-getting-kille https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/14/java-inside-docker/ https://merikan.com/2019/04/jvm-in-a-container/ Java memory management and configuration is still complex. Although the JVM can read cgroup memory limits and adapt memory usage accordingly since Java 9/8u131, it\u2019s not a golden bullet. You need to know what -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap does and you need to fine tune some parameters for every deployment. Otherwise you risk wasting resources and money or getting your containers killed at the worst time possible. -XX:MaxRAMFraction=1 is especially dangerous.

Keptn\u2019s architecture solves a key problem with traditional automation tools where process and tool integrations are often hard coded or hard to maintain. Keptn uses an event-driven orchestrator with declarative process and tooling definitions that eliminate the need for any custom tool integration and make changing processes or tools a matter of changing a config file entry! At the core Keptn integrates with your observability platforms to automate SRE best practices such as SLO validation as part of your DevOps delivery and operations automation.

How can we reduce that? One option is applying Google\u2019s SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) &amp; SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation. This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines.</li> <li>In this session you learn the basics of picking good SLIs &amp; SLOs and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins.

In comparison with similar tools, it provides UI for managing the process and cloud platform to share data with your team.<ul> <li>medium: Happy trip to Kubernetes in our company Kubernetes Local Development Made Easy! Not Minikube, neither Skaffold, but Tilt to the rescue.<ul> <li>Minikube: Initially, they found Minikube as the first solution to manipulate K8s and test everything in our local environment. To manually deploy a service in Minikube they had to build the image in docker every time they made a change. If you are only managing one service this would be easy to handle, but if we work with many services in a repository that needs to be running to work as expected, we should have a way to run those builds automatically and restart the pods to take the new image.</li> <li>Skaffold: They researched how to automatize this and found Skaffold, a tool to create a complete dev environment fully integrated with Kubernetes and Minikube. Skaffold takes over to build all the images that you need, restart the pods and listen for more changes. With this, you can achieve a hot-building feature sending everything to minikube, the devs won\u2019t have to take care of this task. It was a win for them to find this tool.</li> <li>Challenge: Something that caused friction for the developers was the way they had to run all the code locally. They had to make changes using docker-compose and then, test using Skaffold. This may generate little delays in the development workflow.</li> <li>Tilt to the rescue: Finally, they found Tilt - An open-source tool that is focused on generating a comfortable and customizable rebuild for Docker and Kubernetes. Tilt makes really easy to manage development in a local environment of many services that need to communicate among them. Also, it\u2019s focused on the Developer Experience. Once they implemented Tilt, they were able to use their services in the dev phase by running: tilt up. With a well-written configuration and settings, you can get reloads in a few milliseconds using the sync feature. Also, it has easy integration with Helm which is the most used package manager for K8s.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>garden.io</li> <li>microcks.io K8s-based API mock/test tool.<ul> <li>microcks.io: Podman Compose support in Microcks</li> </ul> </li> <li>loft.sh: Checklist for Kubernetes-Based Development \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>loft.sh: Kubernetes Development Environments \u2013 A Comparison</li> <li>loft.sh: Skaffold vs Tilt vs DevSpace</li> <li>yitaek.medium.com: Useful Tools for Better Kubernetes Development \ud83c\udf1f Lens, Polaris, kube-hunter, kube-bench, Trivy, Goldilocks, Kyverno, kube-ps1, kubectx + kubens , krew, kubectl-neat, kube-no-trouble, helm-mapkubeapis, kube-diff + helm-diff , kube forwarder, kubecost, kubespy.</li> <li>cncf.io: Tools to develop apps on Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>blog.usejournal.com: Useful Tools for Better Kubernetes Development</li> <li>rookout.com: Developer Tools for Kubernetes in 2021: Helm, Kustomize, and Skaffold (Part 1)<ul> <li>rookout.com: Developer Tools for Kubernetes in 2021 \u2013 Skaffold, Tilt, and Garden (Part 2) In that previous blog post, I also mentioned another tool \u2013 Skaffold.

Network policy is expressed as a YAML configuration and works very well with GitOps. By adopting GitOps, security teams benefit in the following ways:<ul> <li>Take your policies with you. Kubernetes cluster creation from code is fairly common. It is much easier and less error-prone to push your Git-based policies to a new cluster.</li> <li>You can monitor policy changes using information from pull requests. This will also be easy to integrate with your existing systems, instead of writing integrations from scratch. If something goes wrong, you can simply roll back to an earlier commit.</li> <li>You can lock down who can deploy security policies. If you lock it down to only a single Git user, that will be easy to control. Everybody else can push their policy changes into Git via pull request.</li> <li>Your GitOps tool can ensure that it will override any accidental or malicious change at runtime. This solves a major compliance concern. Git becomes the source of truth for your security policies.</li> <li>It would be much easier to manage if no user could create a security policy from kubectl. Then you can enable de-centralized security by creating specific users for different services, and giving them rights to deploy only specific policies. Developers and DevOps teams are very comfortable with the notion of a Git pipeline.</li> </ul> </li> <li>blog.devgenius.io: K8s Networking \u2014 Calico (Part1) Introduction to Calico.</li> <li>medium.com/@arbnair97: Introduction to Kubernetes Network Policy and Calico Based Network Policy Kubernetes Network Policies are designed to control the network\u2019s traffic flow in and out of the cluster.

Developers may also be responsible for some parts of Kubernetes configuration. As that process shifts left, developers need support to make the right decisions for the organization in order to run Kubernetes securely and efficiently.</li> <li>Many companies are adopting cloud native technologies to deliver speed to market. For businesses seeking to compete in today\u2019s marketplace, it\u2019s important to ship new features and meet customer needs where they are \u2014 and increasingly those needs are being met through software.</li> </ul> </li> <li>weave.works: Production Ready Checklists for Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>containerjournal.com: The Rise of the KubeMaster \ud83c\udf1f<ul> <li>It wasn\u2019t obvious while it was happening, probably because everyone was focused on dealing with a global pandemic, but your IT environment became more complex. Cloud technology continued to evolve, and while that was happening, cloud use grew. Hybrid cloud use, already growing before the pandemic, became much more established with a year-over-year annual growth rate of 17.8%, according to Quince Market Insights. And with more distinct technology advances from each of the major cloud service providers, multi-cloud use also became more established.</li> <li>This more complex environment encouraged the use of containers, and Kubernetes became the preferred means of managing them. Unfortunately, the great irony of Kubernetes is that the technology created to make the management of modern cloud applications easier is, itself, incredibly difficult to manage. Just to deploy and manage a single application in your own data center requires working familiarity with a Kubernetes distribution and working integrations with a number of supporting systems and enterprise software including code registries, CI/CD, secrets management, storage management, networking, logging and monitoring, service mesh, backup and disaster recovery (DR). That\u2019s just for one environment. In a hybrid infrastructure, perhaps using one of the leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure or GCP, you could double this overhead.</li> <li>This rapid growth combined with immense complexity means not every Kubernetes implementation has been successful, and in the worst cases, misconfigurations have led to security breaches and significant application downtime. Overwhelmed teams with insufficient training only make the problem worse, putting these implementations farther behind as Kubernetes management becomes increasingly difficult. As such, I believe the time is now for a new role to emerge in the enterprise\u2014Kubernetes Manager. This is a job function that more and more companies will need to hire as operating and managing Kubernetes becomes a significantly larger part of the engineering operation than ever before.

And this shift to full-spectrum accountability brings about dramatic improvements in the overall speed, reliability, security and cost of applications.</li> <li>Of course, it\u2019s not always easy to determine which organizations need this level of ownership. When businesses grow, they typically discover that pushing the delivery of applications and services through a gate of operations is challenging at best, impossible at worst. Even so, the DevSecOps mindset is on the rise, which means teams are now seeking ways to make this type of shift into more meaningful and effective ownership.

Because they work independently, they can be added, removed, or upgraded without interfering with other applications. While there are numerous benefits to microservices architecture, like easier deployment and testing, improved productivity, flexibility, and scalability, they also pose a few disadvantages, as independently run microservices require a seamless method of communication to operate as one larger application. Event-driven microservices allow for real-time microservices communication, enabling data to be consumed in the form of events before they\u2019re even requested. In this white paper, we\u2019ll cover how event-driven microservices work, presenting a sample currency exchange platform to illustrate the design and architecture of an application composed of event-driven microservices using Apache Kafka\u00ae and Confluent Platform. We also discuss other aspects of microservices architectures, such as team structure, continuous delivery, deployment, and testing. Lastly, we discuss how Apache Kafka and Confluent Platform enable and extend core principles of microservices, including decoupling, separation of concerns, agility, and real-time streaming of event data.</li> <li>redhat.com: Event-driven architecture: Understanding the essential benefits \ud83c\udf1f Event-driven architectures bring significant benefits when managing many endpoints, but it also has its complexities to be aware of.</li> <li>medium: Introduction to Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>headspring.com: Is Kafka or RabbitMQ the right messaging tool for you?</li> <li>dzone: Why Pub/Sub Isn\u2019t Enough for Modern Apps Pub/Sub is the most appropriate way of architecting the delivery side of an event-driven architecture (especially for the web).</li> <li>baeldung.com: Pub-Sub vs. Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>engineering.atspotify.com: Spotify\u2019s Event Delivery \u2013 The Road to the Cloud (Part I)</li> <li>medium: Monolithic to Microservices Architecture with Patterns &amp; Best Practices \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>infoq.com: Turning Microservices Inside-Out</li> <li>towardsdatascience.com: Architecture for High-Throughput Low-Latency Big Data Pipeline on Cloud \ud83c\udf1f Scalable and efficient data pipelines are as important for the success of analytics, data science, and machine learning as reliable supply lines are for winning a war.</li> <li>dzone: RESTful Applications in An Event-Driven Architecture Hybrid architecture with both RESTful and event-driven services.</li> <li>developers.redhat.com: Distributed transaction patterns for microservices compared</li> <li>thenewstack.io: The Rise of Event-Driven Architecture</li> <li>jinwookim928.medium.com: Why Not Event Driven Architecture?</li> <li> <p>thenewstack.io: Streaming Data and the Modern Real-Time Data Stack</p> Modern Data Stack Modern Real-Time Data Stack Language SQL SQL Deployment Cloud-native Cloud-native Data Ops Complex batch transformations every 15 minutes, hourly or daily Simple incremental transformations every second Insights Monthly, Weekly or Daily Instantly Cost Affordable at massive scale Affordable at massive scale and speed </li> <li> <p>blog.direktiv.io: Event driven orchestration with Knative (part 1)</p> </li> <li>blog.direktiv.io: Redefining event-driven orchestration for automation &amp; applications</li> <li>pub.towardsai.net: Deep Dive into Event-Driven architecture | Gul Ershad</li> <li>developer.com: An Introduction to Event Driven Microservices</li> <li>dzone.com: What Are Microservices and The Event Aggregator Pattern? \ud83c\udf1f Learn about the Event Aggregator pattern for organizing event communication in a microservices architecture with an example.</li> <li>ibm.com: Event-driven cloud-native applications (microservices) The event backbone is being part of the microservices mesh, providing the publish-and-subscribe communication between microservices and enabling the support of loosely coupled event-driven microservices.</li> <li>irfanyusanif.medium.com: Best practices to communicate between microservices</li> <li>swapnil-chougule.medium.com: Rapid Feature Engineering through SQL</li> <li>blog.twitter.com: Processing billions of events in real time at Twitter</li> <li>codeopinion.com: Event Sourcing vs Event Driven Architecture</li> <li>thenewstack.io: The Path to Getting the Full Data Stack on Kubernetes</li> <li>medium.com/tinyclues-vision: 4 Design Principles for Robust Data Pipelines Design Principles for traditional Software Engineering quickly fail when working with large and diverse sets of data \u2014 a new way of thinking about this difference.</li> <li>medium.com/fiverr-engineering: How to Share Data Between Microservices on High Scale Several approaches suitable for a scalable system considering tradeoffs between availability and consistency</li> <li>medium.com/codex: Microservices Communication \u2014 Queues Topics and Streams In this article, I will speak about types of messages broker that are famous in microservices communication.</li> <li>blog.bitsrc.io: Why Microservices Should use Event Sourcing \ud83c\udf1f 6 Reasons where you need to use Event Sourcing in Micro-services</li> <li>emirayhan.medium.com: What is the difference Message Queue and Message Bus? \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>verraes.net: DDD and Messaging Architectures \ud83c\udf1f An overview of my different series on patterns in distributed systems.

When you have a huge number of applications talking to each other there is an enormous amount of logs that they produce. Handling this amount of logs can be very costly and a headache. Let\u2019s look at this problem for handling your logs at scale and Logging infrastructure System Design.</li> <li>medium.com: Monitoring Microservices - Part 1: Observability | Anderson Carvalho Achieving observability with probes, logs, metrics, and traces. The Observability Pyramid comprises Probes, Logs, Metrics, and Traces:<ul> <li>Probes: Probes are often exposed as endpoints and used by external agents like load balancers, container orchestrators, application servers, and sysadmins before deciding what to do next. The most common probes are starting, ready, and live. The startup probe is on during the component bootstrap phase. The liveness probe is on from the time the component starts until it stops running. The readiness probe is on during the period where the component is ready/open to receive requests or process workload.</li> <li>Logs: Logs are messages produced during the component execution that capture a piece of relevant information. Usually, we classify log messages into all, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal. Logs can produce a huge amount of data and contain sensitive information. A good practice is to apply different log levels depending on the environment.</li> <li>Log Aggregation: Each component generates one or more log files. Since distributed systems are composed of multiples components, it\u2019s a daunting and miserable task to dig into a bunch of log files during troubleshooting. Thus, log aggregation is highly recommended for Microservices.</li> <li>Metrics: Metrics give us the visibility of good and bad events that happen inside of an application. Metrics help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal application behavior. Usually, we collect, count, summarize and compare events related to rate, errors, duration, and saturation to produce metrics.</li> <li>Traces: Traces record the flow of data between different components and execution details of each one along the way. By tracing we can discover the relationships, dependencies between components, identify bottlenecks, comprehend the data flow, and the time span on each component.</li> </ul> </li> <li>infoworld.com: The RED method: A new strategy for monitoring microservices By using the RED metrics\u2014rate, error, and duration\u2014you can get a solid understanding of how your services are performing for end-users.</li> <li>intellipaat.com: Top 10 DevOps Monitoring Tools Are you a DevOps engineer?

This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a  detailed view of individual requests as they \u201chop\u201d through a system of microservices. With distributed tracing you can:<ul> <li>Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system.</li> <li>Discover the latency of the components along that path.</li> <li>Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Performance: Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It\u2019s possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn\u2019t one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. Adding traces with OpenCensus is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter.</li> <li>Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World: In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams.<ul> <li>For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can\u2019t schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like Istio exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like OpenCensus, you can deeply understand what\u2019s happening with and within each service.</li> <li>All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team \u2014 not just for the operations team.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Older Distributed Tracing Solutions:<ul> <li>Dapper (Google)</li> <li>Zipkin (A.K.A.

Prometheus is software built for monitoring large, scalable systems and storing historical runtime data over an extended time period. The AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format, enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data.You can also use a graphical tool, such as Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects.The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself. ref1, ref2, ref3 Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) JMX, OpenTracing+Jaeger ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using Java Management Extensions (JMX). Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans. JMX works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on. By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect.Distributed Tracing with Jaeger: - Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as Kafka clients) - MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect  - Kafka Bridge ref1,ref2 Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator AMQ Streams Operator (Prometheus &amp; Jaeger), strimzi, jmxtransHow to monitor AMQ Streams Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for example Grafana dashboards.Support for distributed tracing in AMQ Streams, using Jaeger: - You instrument Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data.  - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams. To configure these components for distributed tracing, you configure and update the relevant custom resources. ref1, ref2, ref3 strimzi, ref4: jmxtrans, ref5: banzai operator Red Hat AMQ Broker Operator Prometheus (recommended) or Jolokia REST to JMX To monitor runtime data for brokers in your deployment, use one of these approaches: - Section 9.1, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using Prometheus\u201d - Section 9.2, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using JMX\u201d In general, using Prometheus is the recommended approach. However, you might choose to use the Jolokia REST interface to JMX if a metric that you need to monitor is not exported by the Prometheus plugin.

OpenShift Container Platform uses the Multus CNI plug-in to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins. During cluster installation, you configure your default Pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can define an additional network based on the available CNI plug-ins and attach one or more of these networks to your Pods. You can define more than one additional network for your cluster, depending on your needs. This gives you flexibility when you configure Pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing.</li> <li>You can use an additional network in situations where network isolation is needed, including data plane and control plane separation. Isolating network traffic is useful for the following performance and security reasons:<ul> <li>Performance: You can send traffic on two different planes in order to manage how much traffic is along each plane.</li> <li>Security: You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that must not be shared between tenants or customers.</li> </ul> </li> <li>All of the Pods in the cluster still use the cluster-wide default network to maintain connectivity across the cluster. Every Pod has an eth0 interface that is attached to the cluster-wide Pod network. You can view the interfaces for a Pod by using the oc exec -it  \u2013 ip a command. If you add additional network interfaces that use Multus CNI, they are named net1, net2, \u2026\u200b, netN. <li>To attach additional network interfaces to a Pod, you must create configurations that define how the interfaces are attached. You specify each interface by using a Custom Resource (CR) that has a NetworkAttachmentDefinition type.

An image stream is an abstraction for referencing container images from within OpenShift while the referenced images are an image registry such as OpenShift internal registry, Quay, or other external registries. Image streams are capable of defining triggers which allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an image is available in the backing image registry. This in effect enables rebuilding all images that are based on a particular base image as soon as a new version of the base image is available in the Red Hat container catalog and therefore updates all images with the latest bug, CVE, and vulnerability fixes delivered in the latest base image. The challenge, however, is that this capability is limited to BuildConfigs in OpenShift and does not allow more complex workflows to be triggered when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. Furthermore, it is also limited to the scope of a single cluster and its internal OpenShift registry.</li> <li>Fortunately, though, using Red Hat Quay as a central registry in combination with OpenShift Pipelines enables infinite possibilities in designing sophisticated workflows for ensuring a secure software supply chain and automatically performing any set of actions whenever images are pushed, updated, or security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Red Hat container catalog.</li> <li>In this blog post, we will highlight how Red Hat Quay can be integrated with Tekton pipelines to trigger application rebuilds when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog.

Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let\u2019s understand the two network models a bit more in depth.</li> <li>Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules (perimeter defense).</li> <li>Conclusion: A company\u2019s security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones.

En lugar de empujar las m\u00e9tricas (\u201cpushing metrics\u201d) hacia la herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n, extrae (\u201cpull\u201d) las m\u00e9tricas de los servicios (por defecto un \u201c/metrics\u201d HTTP endpoint) en texto plano (parseable por humanos y de f\u00e1cil diagn\u00f3stico). Prometheus tambi\u00e9n tiene un \u201cpush gateway\u201d, de modo que tambi\u00e9n soporta \u201cpush\u201d para m\u00e9tricas espec\u00edficas cuando el modelo de \u201cpull\u201d no funciona (si bien este m\u00e9todo no es recomendable).</li> <li>Prometheus se puede conectar a series de tiempo (time series) con un nombre de m\u00e9trica y pares clave-valor, simplificando la monitorizaci\u00f3n en complejos entornos cloud multi-nodo.</li> <li>La herramienta tambi\u00e9n proporciona PromQL, para el procesado de datos \u201ctime-series\u201d. Permite realizar consultas (queries) para la manipulaci\u00f3n de datos y generar nueva informaci\u00f3n relevante. Con PromQL se pueden generar gr\u00e1ficos, visualizar conjuntos de datos, crear tablas, y generar alertas basadas en par\u00e1metros espec\u00edficos.</li> <li>La consola web de Prometheus permite gestionar todas las caracter\u00edsticas y herramientas disponibles en Prometheus. Se pueden utilizar expresiones regulares y consultas avanzadas de PromQL para la creaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de datos (datasets) y alertas.</li> <li>Prometheus activamente \u201cscrapea\u201d datos, los almacena, y soporta \u201cqueries\u201d, \u201cgr\u00e1ficos\u201d y \u201calertas\u201d, as\u00ed como proporciona \u201cendpoints\u201d a otros consumidores API como Grafana. Todo esto lo realiza con los siguientes componentes:<ul> <li>Librer\u00edas cliente: instrumentaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de aplicaci\u00f3n (para generar eventos).</li> <li>Servidor Prometheus: \u201cscrapeando\u201d y almacenando estos eventos, cuando se generan, como \u201ctime series data\u201d. Este es el modelo \u201cpull\u201d m\u00e1s com\u00fan para la recogida general de m\u00e9tricas en Prometheus.</li> <li>Pushgateway: Modelo \u201cPush\u201d, soportando trabajos ef\u00edmeros de importaci\u00f3n de datos. S\u00f3lo recomendable en aplicaciones \u201cserverless\u201d, donde las aplicaciones son lanzadas y destruidas bajo demanda, as\u00ed como las aplicaciones que manejan \u201cbatch jobs\u201d.</li> <li>Exportadores de Datos: exportando servicios como HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Prometheus se diferencia de otros sistemas de monitorizaci\u00f3n con las siguientes funcionalidades:<ul> <li>Modelo de datos multi-dimensional, donde los \u201ctime-series data\u201d se definen por el nombre de la m\u00e9trica y dimensiones clave/valor.</li> <li>Nodos \u00fanicos de servidor y aut\u00f3nomos, sin dependencia de almacenamiento distribuido.</li> <li>Recogida de datos via un modelo \u201cpull\u201d sobre HTTP.</li> <li>\u201cTime Series Data\u201d empujado (\u201cpushed\u201d) a otros destinos de datos v\u00eda un gateway intermediario.</li> <li>\u201cTargets\u201d descubiertos via \u201cservice discovery\u201d \u00f3 configuraci\u00f3n est\u00e1tica.</li> <li>Soporte de federaci\u00f3n horizontal y vertical.</li> </ul> </li> <li>magalix.com: Monitoring of Kubernetes Clusters To Manage Large Scale Projects</li> <li>Cloud Native Monitoring with Prometheus \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>itnext.io - Prometheus: yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter \u2014 collecting AWS CloudWatch metrics</li> <li>Prometheus Monitoring Ecosystem Begins to Mature</li> <li>learnsteps.com: Monitoring Infrastructure System Design</li> <li>ganeshvernekar.com: Prometheus TSDB (Part 1): The Head Block</li> <li>ganeshvernekar.com: Prometheus TSDB (Part 2): WAL and Checkpoint</li> <li>ganeshvernekar.com: Prometheus TSDB (Part 3): Memory Mapping of Head Chunks from Disk</li> <li>ganeshvernekar.com: Prometheus TSDB (Part 4): Persistent Block and its Index</li> <li>youtube playlist: How to setup Prometheus \ud83c\udf1f</li> <li>learndevops.substack.com: Hitting prometheus API with curl and jq \ud83c\udf1f Determine offending pods that use more RAM than requested, causing OOM.</li> <li>devclass.com: Safety\u2026first?

But lots of people face issues while deploying it on Kubernetes. For me, I had the knowledge of how Kubernetes works, but I had trouble deploying the collector or at times instrumenting my application. The resources on the internet are a bit scattered and it requires a lot of time to go through them. There is a lack of resources that can show you a concrete implementation of OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes from start to finish (or some of them are very cleverly hidden). So I decided to write this blog to demonstrate a very simple implementation of how to deploy a collector to collect metrics and then export the data to various backends for observability. In another blog, I will show how an application in GoLang can be instrumented to expose metrics.</li> <li>thenewstack.io: Maximizing Kubernetes Efficiency with OpenTelemetry Tracing OTEL tracing can collect detailed data on request execution and provide visibility into the entire system.

There are several solutions to address this issue, but generally speaking, a modification will be applied using terraform apply. The code is actually written using the HCL configuration files (declarative), but the execution is done imperatively.

Anyone experienced in designing enterprise grade reusable terraform code?<ul> <li>They should be as simple as possible.</li> <li>Root modules should manage very few resources and not depend heavily on many other modules or remote states.</li> <li>Don\u2019t ever design with the intention of overriding tf variables with environment variables, using -target, etc. Hard code as many values as you can into tfvars files.</li> <li>Use the lock files and pin versions everywhere. Module versions, Git tag versions, provider versions, Terraform versions.</li> <li>Use asdf to install and run the pinned version of Terraform for each root module deployed.</li> <li>Try to keep modules cohesive and loosely coupled. If updating one module or tfvars file creates plan changes in 20 different root modules, that\u2019s not great. Sometimes unavoidable, but creates a large operational burden.</li> <li>Reuse public modules. There\u2019s a shit ton of weird subtle magic knowledge you need to use a resource that isn\u2019t documented and you won\u2019t find out until something breaks.</li> <li>Test creating, changing, and then destroying, every resource. You will probably find a few need hacks to work as you expect.</li> <li>Use semver and version/release all your modules and repos. Keep Changelogs of changes.</li> <li>Keep a file in the root dir of repos that documents the owner or SME of the module and how to contact them.</li> <li>For commonly referenced variables, store them in JSON, export them with <code>output</code>s, publish the module in its own repo somewhere, version it. Modules can reference that module to get the values, pin to versions of it so unexpected changes don\u2019t blow things up.</li> <li>Use the CloudPosse Terraform modules / architecture / framework. Take the time to figure out how they work, use them. I swear you will end up reinventing it over time if you don\u2019t start now. In particular, you should apply a standard AWS tagging scheme with all your resources, which the CloudPosse modules support inherently. They also let you enable/disable functionality by variables, which is nice, cuz otherwise you have to comment out code.</li> <li>Run your Terraform from CI/CD. Really you will be doing it from both your desktop and CI/CD, but assume you\u2019ll be running in CI/CD. Once you have 3 people working on the same TF code at once, you\u2019ll need the CI/CD to not bump into each other all the time. The rule of thumb is, if it\u2019s brand new code, you can run it locally, but if it\u2019s already in production and other things depend on it, run it from ci/cd. <code>apply</code>s anyway.</li> <li>Separate modules by separation of concern; networking in network modules, clusters in cluster modules, apps in app modules, iam in security modules, etc. Also try to separate modules by AWS architectural paradigms, like \u201cglobal\u201d resources in their own modules. You\u2019ll want different teams to maintain and run their own modules independently, even though it all applies to the same AWS account/product stack.</li> <li>Don\u2019t force authentication options into the provider configs. Allow whatever\u2019s running terraform to authenticate first, and the module will just detect the auth method automatically through the provider\u2019s sdk.</li> <li>Don\u2019t make a module for a module\u2019s sake. Whereas with regular app code you might make a bunch of abstractions to try to make the code more manageable, that just makes Terraform suck more. Use the least number of abstractions possible to achieve what you want.</li> </ul> </li> <li>medium.com/@junjun231953_53717: Terraform Best Practices</li> <li>iopshub.medium.com: Terraform Best Practices Everyone Should Know</li> <li>thomasthornton.cloud: Using Terraform tfvars for environment-agnostic deployments \ud83c\udf1f</li> </ul>"},{"location":"terraform/#terraform-and-cicd-terraform-workspaces","title":"Terraform and CI/CD.

The source IP address\n# of the traffic is NAT'd to the node's IP address.\n\n# With kubenet there's NO Pod-to-Pod communication because they don't have their own public IPs.\n# User Defined Routing (UDR) and IP forwarding is used for communication between pods across nodes.\n\n# Kubenet is the preferred method since you get more pods per node and the AKS Cluster scales to a bigger number.\n# With kubenet Max Number of Pods per Node: 110\n# With Kubenet and CIDR =/24 : 251 nodes * 110 pods per node = 27.610 pods\n# With Azure CNI (instead of kubenet) and CIDR =/24 : 8 nodes * 30 pods per node = 240 pods\n\n# If we have limited IP addresses to work with, we can fit more pods in the limited IP address space because we can\n# fit more pods per node.\n\n# The Service CIDR, Pod CIDR, and Docker Bridge Access can be any address range.\n# The DNS Service IP must be any IP address that's within the Service CIDR address range.\n\n# Network settings (service_cidr, pod_cidr, docker_bridge_cidr, dns_service_ip) are commented. The below values\n# correspond to the applied default values when these settings are note set up.\n\n# Default network settings with kubenet when they are not configured:\n# Azure AKS VNet      = \"10.0.0.0/8\"\n# Azure AKS Subnet    = \"10.240.0.0/16\"\n# service_cidr        = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n# pod_cidr            = \"10.244.0.0/16\"\n# docker_bridge_cidr  = \"172.17.0.1/16\" # Default.

Tools such as AWS CloudFormation, Kubernetes and Helm expect configuration files in JSON or YAML syntax, presumably in an attempt to make them easy to write and process. However, in most cases, teams quickly reach the point where they have some parts that are similar but not quite the same, for example, when the same service must be deployed in different regions with a slightly different setup. For such cases tools offer templating in YAML (or JSON), which has caused a huge amount of frustration with practitioners. The problem is that the syntax of JSON and YAML requires all sorts of awkward compromises to graft templating features such as conditionals and loops into the files. We recommend using an API from a programming language instead or, when this is not an option, a templating system in a programming language, either a general-purpose language such as Python or something specialized such as Jsonnet.</li> <li>Steve Horsfield: DevOps tricks - Templating YAML files Basic text tools fall foul of YAML\u2019s indentation sensitivity.
